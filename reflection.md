I changed up my design since I was not as limited as I was in plain HTML, I added new colors, differing font sizes, and hovering effects. Some of the challenges I faced was the media queries and changing some things on certain pages but eventually figured it out. I didn't do mobile first even though I probably should've but I just made the navbar stack, when JS is introduced I will make it a hamburger.
